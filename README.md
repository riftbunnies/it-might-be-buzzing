# 🐇 it-might-be-buzzing

_A softly humming repository of riftbunny knowledge, rituals, field notes, and tools for living a functional life on the shimmering edge of the inexplicable._

This repository exists to collect and preserve all known (and suspected) information related to:

- 🌀 **The Rift** Its behaviors, inconsistencies, and emotional tones.
- 🐇 **Riftbunnies** Their customs, clothing rules, memory fragments, and cuddle clusters.
- 🔧 **Helpful Tools** Scripts, rituals, and small code-things for organizing chaos gently.  

If it buzzes, we log it.  
If it hums, we listen.  
If it disappears, we check the pantry.

## Contents
- 📁 lore/ → summaries, culture docs, strange truths
- 📁 scripts/ → helper tools, maybe useful, maybe haunted
- 📁 rituals/ → field-tested routines for Rift living
- 📁 observations/ → sightings, timelines, sandwich anomalies
- .gitignore → politely declined files

More folders may appear. We trust the Rift to organize things when it’s ready.
